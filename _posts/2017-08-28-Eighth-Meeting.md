Discussion: Bringing Product Ideas to Market

Aug 28, 2017, 6:30pm, JAAC (15th & Wedgewood) Room 1037, Belmont University

Our next meeting will be a group discussion on "taking product ideas from concept to market". I reserved room 1037 in the Ayers building (we've either met in 1037 or 1034 before). Really looking forward to having a mixture of seasoned pros and people with no experience but cool ideas. Some and let's talk!
