Work time & potluck!  Instead of working alone, show up and get dinner + work out of the way, in a supportive, collaborative atmosphere.
"Potluck" means bring something for yourself to much on or drink, with extra to share.


We'll provide sodas & some food (probably fried chicken -- great for typing! lol!).


Same time & place as last time.
