Attention academics & amateurs, creatives and coders, entrepreneurs and enthusiasts, makers & musicians, scientists & slackers, techies & tinkerers! Let's band together to bring our ideas to life! Starting "ASPIRE: A Research Co-Op" (https://aspirecoop.github.io)
This group can be part meetup, part hackathon series, part laboratory-makerspace, part innovation incubator, and part journal-worthy research powerhouse, driven by our interests, resources & passions. :-)

Location: Room 4098, Janet Ayers Academic Center, Belmont University.

Launching a "Research Co-op" for members of the Nashville community -- academics, entrepreneurs, engineers, musicians and enthusiasts -- to collaborate on innovative projects involving audio, acoustics, engineering, and so on.

For this meeting, We're going to hear and/or try out demos from a few people on what they're working on...
- Lucas Novick's experiments on the Kemper Profiling Amplifer!
- Tony Lassandro's sound field viz mobile app! (https://github.com/lassandroan/SoniColor, more on that later)
- Joe Erichsen's VR acoustics app development (status update & maybe demo).
- ..and talk about the vision for what this group will become. I (@drscotthawley) will buy pizza & drinks.


This will be open to the public, and we'll be inviting members from other meetups & labs to join & advise us!

This event is jointly sponsored by Belmont University College of Sciences & Mathematics and the Music City Chapter of the Acoustical Society of America (https://www.facebook.com/MusicCityASA/)!
