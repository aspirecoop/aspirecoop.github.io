Attention academics & amateurs, creatives and coders, entrepreneurs and enthusiasts, makers & musicians, scientists & slackers, techies & tinkerers! Let's band together to bring our ideas to life! Starting "ASPIRE: A Research Co-Op" (https://aspirecoop.github.io)
This group can be part meetup, part hackathon series, part laboratory-makerspace, part innovation incubator, and part journal-worthy research powerhouse, driven by our interests, resources & passions. :-)

Location: Room 4098, Janet Ayers Academic Center, Belmont University.

Launching a "Research Co-op" for members of the Nashville community -- academics, entrepreneurs, engineers, musicians and enthusiasts -- to collaborate on innovative projects involving audio, acoustics, engineering, and so on.

For this meeting, We're going to hear and/or try out demos from a few people on what they're working on...

* Lucas Novick's experiments on the [Kemper Profiling Amplifer](https://www.kemper-amps.com/)!
* [Tony Lassandro](https://github.com/lassandroan)'s sound field viz mobile app! (https://github.com/lassandroan/SoniColor, more on that later)
* Joseph Erichsen's VR acoustics app development (status update & maybe demo).
* ..and talk about the vision for what this group will become. [@drscotthawley](https://twitter.com/drscotthawley) will provide pizza & drinks.


This will be open to the public, and we'll be inviting members from other meetups & labs to join & advise us!

This event is jointly sponsored by [Belmont University College of Sciences & Mathematics](https://www.facebook.com/BelmontCSM/) and the [Music City Chapter of the Acoustical Society of America](https://www.facebook.com/MusicCityASA/)!

Directions: Free parking under the building. Take the *south* elevator to the 4th floor, walk around the corner to the left, then across the elliptical-foyer area, and down an around the hallway to the right. 4098 is facing you from the end of the hall. (If you take the north elevator, it will likely only go to the 3rd floor.)
