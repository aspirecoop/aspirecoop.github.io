Date/Time: Monday, January 22 at 6:30 PM - 8:30 PM

Location: Janet Ayers Academic Center, room 1037, Belmont University, 1500 Wedgeweood Ave, Nashville TN. 

Description: Two "app-related" activities seem apropos for this month, so we’ll do one after the other:
1.	There's been a community request for a demo & training on the (open source) Polar Pattern Plotter iPhone app, so we'll start with that. (~45 minutes)
2.	There's significant interest from several members on pursuing ASPIRE member Ethan Henley's original idea of developing an (A.I.) "automatic tagger & organizer" for libraries of samples & loops. We'll have a brainstorming & design session about this, after the polar pattern demo.  (Gwen & Brett – maybe we can get a status update ready for everybody!)
