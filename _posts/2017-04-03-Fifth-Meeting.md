For this meeting we'll have a few people showing us a bit about something they're working on, with an eye toward how we can learn to do the same:

- Jason Saitta on programming the Tango (3d reckoning device)
- Scott Hawley: "Tutorial on Recurrent Neural Networks"
- We'll also have some students making impulse responses at different locations in the room, who can show & tell us what they're doing.

Hope to see you!

Location: 15th & Wedgewood, JAAC building room 1034, Belmont University
Time: 6:30pm - 8:30pm.
