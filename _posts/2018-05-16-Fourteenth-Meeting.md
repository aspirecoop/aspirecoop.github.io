"Potluck, Personal HRTFs, and Steerable Subs"

This month we'll meet at Hawley's home studio "Cube Ranch", (PM @drscotthawley for address), for some food & fellowship. 

Activity-wise, we'll have the studio setup for making personalized Head Related Transfer Function measurements (15 mins each) using [earfish](http://www.earfish.eu)'s system, 
and in the living room members will share what they've been working on -- including Parker Anderson's honors thesis in live sound design! ;-)
Bring something to share to eat or drink, we'll see you then!
